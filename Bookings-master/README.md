# bookings
This project is an Airbnb clone and I was put in charge of building the Bookings module. 

So just to give a little more insight on the bookings module, when a user first views the booking module they are able to see the price of the listing per night, along with the amount of ratings the listing has and the average rating of that listing.

The User is also able to view a calendar that show cases available dates and pick from the selection of available dates and choose the amount of guests that they have so long as the amount of guests is allowed. 

This was a really fun project that I loved working on. When my team first decided to build an Airbnb clone my inital attraction was to the Bookings module. There was just so many things going on within a small compact component that it really sparked my interest. A few of those things being:

1) There was a lot of conditional rendering going on given that each lising would have its own unique set of data. (ie kids allowed/not allowed, amount of guests, available dates)

2) The calendar module really intrigued me because there was more to it than just selecting dates. (I had to make sure that a user would only be able to select a valid date range and not black out dates. I also had to make sure that the date range met the requirements of min/max night stay)

3) Airbnb has a very clean, minimalist approach to the styling of their site, and it was a fun challenge to recreate that but with my own twist.
